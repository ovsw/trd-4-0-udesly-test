  „I took the full Game Dev class and I enjoyed every part of it. I can tell
  from my experience that Alex is a very passionate, enthusiastic and
  experienced trainer. You can see that he really loves what he is doing. The
  information was delivered with professionalism and attention to details. When
  it comes to the practical exercises (and we had plenty of those), he gave lots
  of examples, and he was always there to help us out with our work. Alex always
  encouraged us to continue the practice, and he was always very open to our
  questions, always offering us his support through this journey.”
